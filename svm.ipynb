    "# Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification. It can be used to perform binary or multiclass classification. SVM works by finding the best line (or hyperplane in high-dimensional data) that separates the given groups. The objective of SVM learning is to find the best parameters so that the hyperplane separates the data and maximizes the margin (For a simple discussion about the equations of SVM, have a look at [this paper](https://cgp.iiarjournals.org/content/cgp/15/1/41.full.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The closest points are called support vectors, and they are the points used by SVM to find the best hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdulrahman1123/analysis_examples/main/SVM_hyperplane.png\" width=600 height=200 />\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of SVM include:\n",
    "- SVM is effective in high dimensional spaces\n",
    "- Uses a subset of data points to find the best solution (memory efficient)\n",
    "- Versatility, as it uses different <b>kernel functions</b> to find the best solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernel Functions\n",
    "Kernel functions are what makes SVM stand out among other similar machine learning algorithms. Originally, SVM was proposed to be a linear classification method. But what would you do if the data are not linearly separable (like in the photo below)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, a function (or a transformation if you want) is applied to the data, and then SVM will use the transformed data for its learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdulrahman1123/analysis_examples/main/svm_intro.png\" width=900 height=300 />\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel function in the above image is a custom one, it is applied to to variables, and its function is $f(x_1,x_2) = {x_1}^2+{x_2}^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are custom functions that you can already use using popular packages like scikit-learn. These include the radial basis function (RBF), polynomial function and linear function. The different kernels have differently-shaped decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameters\n",
    "##### The Hyperparameter C\n",
    "This is a regularization parameter. It determines the width of the margin. Higher C values give smaller margins, and might be prone to overfitting. While lower C values are associated with larger margins, and the possibility of underfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdulrahman1123/analysis_examples/main/SVM_hyperplane_2.png\" width=600 height=250 />\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hyperparameter gamma\n",
    "This hyperparameter only applies for the RBF kernel function. It determines how tight the decision boundary is. With lower values being associated with wider decision boundary and more points being grouped together (with the risk of low accuracy). Higher values are associated with points closer together being considered similar, and thus smaller boundaries (with the risk of overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Data Used\n",
    "This dataset was originally publicly available from the paper [Machine Learning Repository of University of California Irvine](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/). This dataset [consists of characteristics, or features, of cell nuclei taken from breast masses which were sampled using fine-needle aspiration (FNA), a common diagnostic procedure in oncology. The clinical samples used to form this dataset were collected from January 1989 to November 1991.] (Sidey-Gibbons and Sidey-Gibbons 2019) Each sample is then classified as malignant or benign in the 'class' column (1= malignant and 0 = benign).\n"
