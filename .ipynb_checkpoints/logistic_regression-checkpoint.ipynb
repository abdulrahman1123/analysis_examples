    "The general formula of linear regression is familiar to most, and is given by $Y = b_0+b_1 X_1$. Graphically, it represents a linear correlation between two continuous variables ($Y$ and $X_1$). But, what type of formula would we need in order to describe a binary variable?\r\n",
    "It turns out that the best formula is logistic regression formula, which, when plotted, will have a sigmoid shape.\r\n",
