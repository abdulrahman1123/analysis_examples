        "# Language Models\n",
        "\n",
        "In our pursuit of making computers understand and generate human-like text, LLM were developed.\n",
        "Language modeling in general is concerned with predicting the next word in a sequence of words. One of the early and basic examples of LMs is the n-gram model, where the probability of a word occurring is calculated based on the previous n-1 words.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in a 5-gram model, and the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", the probability of the word \"dog\" occuring is calculated based on the previous 4 words \"over the lazy\". This is a very simple model and does not capture the context of the sentence very well.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/05/Language-Model-N-gram.jpg\" />\n",

        "\n",
        "## Large Language Models\n",
        "The benifit of N-gram models is limited. This is where large language models (LLMs) come in. LLMs are able to capture the context of the sentence and generate more accurate predictions. They language models that use large neural networks with up to billions of parameters. They can capture more complex syntax and semantics of the human language. They can perform a number of tasks, ranging from translation, identifying offensive content, or even passing professional exams.\n",
        "\n",
        "To further understand LLMs, we will introduce two concepts here, **embedding** and **tokenization**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Embeddings\n",
        "You can think of embeddings as values assigned to words that represent aspects of their meaning. For example, if we want to describe objects in terms of their size and taste, a dog will score high on the size and low on the taste, while a rock will score low on both, and so on. When the model learns such values, it acquires some form of representation of word *meaning*. That is why, **embeddings are a major part of what the models are actually trained on**.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdulrahman1123/analysis_examples/refs/heads/main/embeddings.png\" width=400 height=423 />\n",
        "\n",
        "### Tokenization and Encoding\n",
        "Have you ever subscriped to the 'pay as you go' tier in ChatGPT, Cluade or Deepseek? If so, then you probably noticed that they calculate usage by the number of tokens. But what are tokens?\n",
        "Well, they are the smallest chunks that you split your text into. Usually, they represent sub-word syllables. For example, the word \"unbelievable\" can consist of three tokens, \"un\", \"believ\" and \"able\". However, we can determine the granularity of our definition of tokens, and we can split our data on the letter level, or on the whole-word level if we want to.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we all know how computers love numbers. So, we want to convert all words to numbers before feeding them to the model for training. This is known as **encoding**. When we get the output of the machine, we convert it back to words using **decoding**.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdulrahman1123/analysis_examples/refs/heads/main/tokenization.png\" width=1050 height=225 />\n",
        "\n",
        "Enough talk now. let's start coding.\n",
